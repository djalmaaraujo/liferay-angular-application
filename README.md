# Liferay Angular App Boilerplate

This is an experimental project using Liferay 7 + Angular JS.

This project try to implement the best practices described in [https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/blob/master/a1/README.md#angular-1-style-guide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/blob/master/a1/README.md#angular-1-style-guide).

The main goal is to have a good understanding on how we can use Liferay as a simple REST API, but still using the power of Liferay portal.

Basically this projects is describe as:

1. We have a ```MainApp``` Angular Module.
2. We also have multiple Global Modules for controllers, services and directives.
3. The idea is that every Portlet, can implement it's own Controller, injecting all Common directives, services from the MainApp.

... to be continued.
